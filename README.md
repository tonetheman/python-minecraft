================

python minecraft stuff i was playing with

You need craft bukkit also (a minecraft server that is open source)

Minecraft has versions and so you need to make sure you match versions.

The craft-bukkit I used was for 1.6.4-R2.0

Bukkit was moving on to a 1.7 series release when I grabbed this so it might be further now.

The other thing you need for bukkit is a plugin called RasberryJuice.

Mojang made an official way to talk to a minecraft server for the rasberry pi version of
minecraft. Someone looked at that protocol and duplicated in a plugin for bukkit.
That way you could experiment with the rasberry pi minecraft on bukkit. No need for a pi.
